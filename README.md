# HousePricePrediction
For this project, we began by collecting and
 preprocessing data, and then proceeded to build a
 model that could predict the price of a house based on
 various features such as size, location, and number of
 bedrooms, among others. We tested several algorithms
 for this task, including Neural Networks by Tensorflow,
 as well as Ensemble methods like Random Forest,
 XGBoost, and CatBoost. Finally, I integrated the model
 with a Flask app and a Docker Container.
